# Meta Menu — project conventions

## What this is
SaaS multi-tenant restaurant menu builder. Each tenant is a Better Auth `organization` that owns one or more `restaurant` rows. Admins build menus via drag-and-drop; the public menu renders from the same data.

## Stack
- **Next.js 16** (App Router, Turbopack default, Cache Components)
- **TypeScript** strict
- **Drizzle ORM** + `postgres-js` driver, **Postgres 18**
- **Better Auth** with `organization` plugin
- **shadcn/ui** + Tailwind v4
- **@dnd-kit** for drag-and-drop
- **Bun** as package manager and test runner; **Node** as production runtime (Bun + `next build` is unstable as of 2026 — see oven-sh/bun#23944)

## Hard rules

1. **Tenant scoping is mandatory.** Every query touching `restaurant`, `menu`, `category`, or `item` MUST filter by `restaurantId` AND verify the caller is a `member` of the parent `organization`. Never trust IDs from the client without rechecking ownership. Centralize this in `features/auth/` — use `requireRestaurantAccess(restaurantId)` before any tenant query.

2. **Schema is the source of truth.** `shared/db/schema.ts` is the single canonical schema. Migrations are generated, not handwritten — run `bun run db:generate` then `bun run db:migrate`.

3. **Auth checks belong in the data layer, not in layouts.** Layouts in Next 16 don't re-render on navigation, so an auth check in a layout WILL leak. Use `verifySession()` / `requireRestaurantAccess()` from `features/auth/` close to the data fetch or in the page component itself. The dashboard layout fetches session/plan defensively for chrome (email, Analytics link) but never redirects from there.

4. **Use shadcn via MCP** when possible. `bunx shadcn@latest add <component>` works too. Don't hand-write primitives that already exist in shadcn.

5. **No `middleware.ts`.** Next 16 renamed it to **`proxy.ts`**. The proxy is for *optimistic* redirects only (cookie presence checks). Real auth always lives in the DAL.

6. **Money is integer cents** in `priceCents`, currency in a separate column. Never use floats for prices.

7. **Drag-and-drop reordering** uses integer `position` columns (per parent). On reorder, recompute positions for affected rows in a single transaction. Renumber periodically if gaps grow.

8. **Menu templates are open/closed.** Each template lives in its own folder under `features/menu-publishing/rsc/templates/<id>/` and exports a `template: MenuTemplate` from `index.ts`. The renderer (`menu-renderer.tsx`) consumes only the registry — never edit it to support a new template. Adding a template = new folder + 1 import + 1 entry in `templates/registry.ts` + the literal in `RestaurantTheme.layout` (schema). LAYOUTS in `features/menu-publishing/rsc/theme.ts` is derived from the registry; do not maintain it separately.

9. **Asset keys are tenant-prefixed and verified twice.** Every uploaded object's S3 key starts with `r/{restaurantId}/`. The `requireRestaurantAccess` DAL guard runs first; `assertKeyBelongsToTarget` then rejects any commit whose key doesn't match the target's restaurant — defense-in-depth against a stale presign being redirected. New asset targets must follow the same `r/{restaurantId}/...` scheme in `features/upload/targets.ts` and gate item-scoped uploads with an extra ownership check (see `assertItemBelongsToRestaurant`).

10. **Languages live in a registry.** Each supported language is a self-contained module under `features/i18n/languages/<code>/` exporting `language: Language` from its `index.ts`. `features/i18n/registry.ts` is the only place that knows the full set; `LANGUAGE_CODES`, `LANGUAGE_META`, and `getLanguage` are derived. The Zod schemas in actions use `z.record(z.string(), …).refine(keys ⊂ LANGUAGE_CODES)` because Zod 4 makes `z.record(z.enum([...]), …)` exhaustive. Translatable text uses the pattern: plain `name`/`description` text columns are the source of truth for the restaurant's `defaultLanguage`; sibling jsonb `*I18n` columns carry overrides for non-default languages. Fallback chain at render time: requested → default → empty. New languages: see `/add-language` skill.

11. **Plans live in a registry.** Same shape as languages and templates: each plan is a folder under `features/plans/<code>/` exporting `plan: Plan` from `index.ts`; `features/plans/registry.ts` derives `PLAN_CODES`, `PLANS`, `getPlan`. Adding a plan = new folder + new literal in `PlanCode` union + new registry entry. Gates use `canAddRestaurant(orgId)` (returns structured `{ ok, reason, limit }` — never throws) and `planHas(plan, feature)`. The DB column `organization.plan` stores raw text; `getPlan` coerces unknown values back to the default so a renamed plan never crashes a render.

12. **Public menu is cached, invalidated by tag.** `loadRestaurantSnapshot(slug)` and `loadRestaurantAdminMenus(slug)` (use-cases in `features/menu-publishing/use-cases/`) wrap `unstable_cache` with a per-slug tag `restaurant:${slug}` via `features/menu-publishing/cache.ts`. Every mutation that affects the restaurant's public or admin view MUST call `revalidateRestaurant(slug)` (which uses `updateTag` for read-your-own-writes semantics, not `revalidateTag`). The single chokepoint is enforced — never call `revalidatePath('/r/${slug}')` from a mutation action; the cache tag is what matters. **Date gotcha:** `unstable_cache` JSON-serializes Dates to ISO strings; if a cached function returns a Date the caller will see a string. Hydrate explicitly in the loader (see `loadRestaurantAdminMenus`).

13. **View tracking is beacon-based, not server-render-coupled.** `/api/track/[slug]` is a pixel-beacon route that lives outside the cached snapshot — it runs on every public visit, even when the page itself is served from cache. Dedup is `(visitor_cookie, restaurant_id, hour_bucket)` via `view_seen.onConflictDoNothing`; only newly-inserted rows trigger `incrementDailyView`. Bot UAs filtered at the route. **Never put the view increment back inline in the page** — that breaks the moment a CDN sits in front.

14. **Slices are vertical and own everything for one capability.** Files inside a slice import via *relative* paths; cross-slice imports MUST go through the sibling slice's `index.ts` (the single barrel) — enforced by `eslint-plugin-boundaries` in `eslint.config.mjs`. `shared/` is for primitives with no domain knowledge (db client, env, ui primitives, testing fixtures). `app/` is delivery — routes import from slices and shouldn't carry business logic. Use-cases take their port as the first argument so the test suite wires fakes against a real PGLite database (see `features/auth/auth.test.ts`); production wires the Drizzle adapter once in the slice's `index.ts` or `actions.ts`.

## Pattern: how to add a feature

Reference template: `features/auth/`. Steps:

1. `mkdir features/<slice>/{adapters,use-cases,ui}` — `ui/` only if the slice owns React components.
2. Define **`ports.ts`** — narrow interfaces describing every effect the slice needs (db reads/writes, external APIs). One method per atomic op; no Drizzle / Next types leak through.
3. Write the production **`adapters/drizzle.ts`** (or `better-auth.ts`, `s3.ts`, …). Marked `'server-only'`. Implements the port against the real world.
4. Write **`use-cases/<verb>.ts`** as pure-ish async functions: `(port, input) => result`. No `redirect()` / `headers()` access except via the port — that's what lets Vitest run them against PGLite.
5. Expose the slice via **`index.ts`** — `React.cache()`-memoize page loaders that fan out to children. Re-export types callers need. Don't export the adapter itself.
6. If the slice has mutations, add **`actions.ts`** with `'use server'` at the top: auth guard → `runUseCase(productionAdapter, input)` → `revalidateRestaurant(slug)` (hard rule #12). Server actions don't live in `index.ts` — Next's directive doesn't traverse barrels reliably.
7. Add a co-located **`<slice>.test.ts`** next to the source — `makeTestDb()` from `@/shared/testing/pglite`, real Drizzle queries, fakes only at the port boundary.
8. Add a short **`README.md`** at the slice root documenting the public API.

For asset targets, languages, plans, templates: the registry pattern is already encoded in the matching skill (`add-asset-target`, `add-language`, `add-template`).

## File layout

The codebase is organised as **vertical slices** under `features/` (one folder
per business capability) plus **`shared/`** for cross-slice infrastructure.
Each slice follows a hexagonal-ish layout: `ports.ts` (interfaces) +
`adapters/` (Drizzle/Better Auth implementations) + `use-cases/` (pure logic)
+ `actions.ts` (server-action shells) + `ui/` (slice-owned components) +
`index.ts` (the slice's public API).

## Useful commands
- `bun run dev` — Next.js dev server (Turbopack). Also warns at startup when migrations are pending.
- `bun run typecheck` — TS check without emit
- `bun run lint` — ESLint (boundary rules included)
- `bun run test` / `bun run test:watch` — Vitest unit suite (PGLite, co-located `*.test.ts`)
- `bun run test:e2e` / `:ui` / `:debug` — Playwright suite (production build + start)
- `bun run db:generate` — generate Drizzle migration from `shared/db/schema.ts`
- `bun run db:migrate` — apply pending migrations
- `bun run db:push` — push schema directly (dev only, no migration files)
- `bun run db:studio` — open Drizzle Studio
- `bun run auth:generate` — sync Better Auth tables into `shared/db/schema.ts` (re-run after changing auth plugins)
- `docker compose up -d` — start Postgres + Redis + LocalStack (S3)
- `bunx shadcn@latest add <name>` — add a shadcn component
- `make onprem-bootstrap BOOTSTRAP_USER=pwu` — one-shot: create deploy user + SSH key on an existing Linux box
- `make onprem-setup` — full on-prem provision (Docker, UFW, cloudflared via systemd). Needs `CLOUDFLARED_TUNNEL_TOKEN`.
- `make hetzner-up` — provision a Hetzner Cloud VM end-to-end (Tofu + Ansible). Needs `TF_VAR_hcloud_token` + `TF_VAR_state_passphrase`.
- `make kamal-bootstrap [DEST=hetzner]` — first-time-only fresh-server bootstrap (accessories + setup --skip-hooks + 1st migration)
- `make kamal-deploy [DEST=hetzner]` — build + push + migrate (pre-deploy hook) + zero-downtime roll. DEST defaults to `onprem`.
- `make migrate [DEST=hetzner]` — escape hatch: run `scripts/migrate.mjs` against the running image
- `make help` — list every target

## CI
`.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs three jobs on every push and PR:
- **Typecheck** and **Lint** in parallel (Bun runtime).
- **E2E (Playwright)** with Postgres 18, Redis 7, and LocalStack as service containers. Build runs under Node (`node --run build`) because Bun + `next build` is unstable. Caches `.next/cache` and `~/.cache/ms-playwright`.

Branch protection: deliberately NOT enabled — solo, AI-driven project; the CI itself is the signal. Revisit when adding collaborators or after the first "broken main" incident.

## Where to look when unsure
1. `node_modules/next/dist/docs/` — bundled, version-matched Next.js docs
2. `node_modules/better-auth/` and the Better Auth README in node_modules — auth APIs
3. `node_modules/drizzle-orm/` — query builder, types
4. `features/<slice>/README.md` — every slice has a short doc describing its public API
5. `docs/architecture.md` — the slice playbook (what goes where + how to add a feature)
6. `docs/testing.md` — the test pyramid (Vitest+PGLite unit; Playwright e2e)

The bundled docs match installed versions — trust them over recall.
