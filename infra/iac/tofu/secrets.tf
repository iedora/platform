# Auto-generated container secrets — Tofu mints them on first apply,
# stores them in encrypted state, and syncs them to BWS for human
# lookup (e.g. psql into the live DB).
#
# Why IAC_ prefix in BWS: the operator's keychain shows two groups
# at a glance — `IAC_BOOTSTRAP_*` (must populate before first deploy)
# and `IAC_*` (Tofu writes these; don't touch). Less cognitive load
# when bootstrapping a fresh environment.

  # Replacing this orphans every previously-encrypted dump in R2.

# NOTE: better-auth's session signing secret (`IEDORA_CORE_SECRET`) is
# NOT minted here. It's an app secret — consumed only by the product
# containers, never by an IaC-managed service — so Stage 4
# (`iedora deploy <product>`) mints + upserts it to BWS via the
# productRuntime's appSecrets mechanism (`infra/deploy/cmd/iedora/
# runtime_docker.go`). Tofu's secrets.tf is reserved for secrets that
# govern how IaC containers boot (postgres password, backup passphrase,
# openobserve admin password).

# Sync the Tofu-managed secrets to BWS under stable IAC_* keys.
#
# One batched resource instead of N parallel ones — see the comment in
# bws-sync's main.go for why. BWS rate-limits mutating calls at ~1/s
# server-side, and Tofu's per-resource parallelism (default 10) had
# 7 simultaneous `bws secret edit` calls hitting 429s and leaving
# the destroy partially complete.
#
# This single `terraform_data` runs `bin/bws-sync` once per apply (or
# destroy), and the binary walks the secret list sequentially.
#
# Why `terraform_data` at all: no Bitwarden-Secrets-Manager provider
# exists in the OpenTofu registry as of 2026-05; `terraform_data` +
# local-exec is the documented escape hatch.
