/**
 * Tenant attribution carried on an AsyncLocalStorage store. Modeled on
 * Trigger.dev's DatasourceAttributeSpanProcessor pattern
 * (apps/webapp/app/v3/tracer.server.ts) — an entrypoint sets the tenant
 * once, then every span created inside that block gets the attribute
 * stamped automatically via TenantContextSpanProcessor.
 *
 * Why AsyncLocalStorage instead of OTel's Context API: the OTel API
 * ships a NoopContextManager by default, which does NOT propagate
 * values until @vercel/otel installs AsyncLocalStorageContextManager
 * at register time. In tests we deliberately don't register
 * (NODE_ENV=test short-circuits), so an OTel-Context-based
 * implementation would silently no-op in every Vitest run — and we'd
 * only catch the bug in staging.
 *
 * ALS sidesteps all of that: same propagation semantics
 * (Node's async_hooks), works without OTel setup, works the same in
 * tests and prod. The SpanProcessor reads from the same ALS in
 * onStart — it does NOT need access to the OTel parent Context.
 *
 * Edge runtime: AsyncLocalStorage is Node-only. We're already gated to
 * NEXT_RUNTIME='nodejs' in every consumer's instrumentation.ts, so this
 * is safe. If a future product runs on Edge, we'll need an alternative
 * (or accept that tenancy stamping doesn't work there).

 * ones deep inside adapters that have no idea what tenant they belong
 * to — get `tenant.restaurant_id` / `tenant.organization_id` stamped
 * on by TenantContextSpanProcessor.
 *
 *   // In requireRestaurantAccess, after the auth check:
 *   return tenantContext.run({ restaurantId, tenantId }, () =>
 *     loadRestaurantSnapshot(slug),
 *   )
 *
 * `fn` may be sync or async; the return type is forwarded as-is. The
 * scope is only active inside `fn` — it does NOT leak to siblings.
