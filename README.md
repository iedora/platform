# Meta Menu

A self-hosted, multi-tenant SaaS for restaurants to build digital menus by
drag-and-drop. Each restaurant gets a public page at `/r/<slug>`; the admin
builds it from the dashboard with reorderable categories and items, image
uploads, themes, multi-language overrides, plans, and analytics.

> **Last updated:** 2026. The codebase is organised as **vertical slices**
> (`features/`) on the outside and **light hexagonal** (ports + adapters +
> use-cases) on the inside. Next.js is a delivery detail.

## Tech stack

- **Next.js 16** (App Router, Turbopack, Cache Components, `proxy.ts`)
- **TypeScript** strict, **Tailwind v4**, **shadcn/ui**, **@dnd-kit**
- **Drizzle ORM** + `postgres-js`, **PostgreSQL 18**
- **Better Auth** with the `organization` plugin
- **Vitest** + **PGLite** for unit tests, **Playwright** for end-to-end
- **Bun** for installs and scripts; **Node** as the production runtime
- **Kamal 2** for zero-downtime deploys; **OpenTofu + Ansible** to provision

## Quick start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/eduvhc/meta-menu.git
cd meta-menu
bun install
cp .env.example .env.local            # then paste a fresh BETTER_AUTH_SECRET
docker compose up -d                  # postgres, redis, localstack
bun run db:migrate
bun run dev
```

Open <http://localhost:3000>, sign up, and you'll be taken through onboarding.

## Project layout

The repo is organised as **vertical slices**. Each slice under `features/`
owns one business capability end-to-end: ports + adapters + use-cases +
server actions + slice-owned UI + a single `index.ts` barrel. Cross-slice
imports go through sibling barrels only. `shared/` holds primitives with
no domain knowledge. `app/` is the Next.js delivery layer.

```
app/         Next.js App Router routes (composition shells only)
features/    one folder per slice — auth, menu-builder, menu-publishing, …
shared/      db client + schema, env, ui primitives, testing fixtures
tests/       Playwright e2e specs + fixtures (Vitest tests are co-located)
docs/        architecture, testing, infra, deploy
infra/       OpenTofu (hetzner/) + Ansible — provisions on-prem and Hetzner servers
scripts/     bootstrap.sh, migrate.mjs, check-migrations.ts
config/      Kamal deploy.yml + per-destination overrides (deploy.onprem.yml, deploy.hetzner.yml)
```
