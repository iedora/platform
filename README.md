# Meta Menu

A self-hosted multi-tenant SaaS for restaurants to build digital menus by drag and drop. Each restaurant gets a public menu page at `/r/<slug>`; the admin builds it from the dashboard with reorderable categories and items.

## Features

- Email + password authentication via Better Auth, with multi-tenant organizations.
- Drag-and-drop menu builder (categories and items, mouse + keyboard).
- Item dialog for name, description, price, availability, photo.
- **Image uploads** (logo, banner, item photos) via presigned PUT to S3-compatible storage (LocalStack local, swap for R2/S3 in prod).
- **Theme editor** with live preview: pick a template (classic, minimal), Google fonts, primary/secondary colors. Values persist in `restaurant.theme` and apply to `/r/<slug>` via CSS variables.
- **Identity editor** for name, description, logo, banner — all changes feed the same live preview.
- **QR code page** per restaurant: SVG/PNG download + print-friendly layout pointing at `/r/<slug>`.
- **Multi-language menus** — restaurant admin picks default + supported languages; items, categories, menus, and the restaurant description carry per-language overrides. Public page negotiates language via `?lang=` or `Accept-Language` and falls back to default for missing translations. Languages are a registry pattern (`lib/i18n/`), so adding a new one is a single folder + one entry.
- **Sample menu seed** — one click creates a realistic bistro menu (3 categories, 8 items) so the dashboard isn't empty during onboarding/demos.
- **Plans (Free / Casa)** — registry pattern (`lib/plans/`). Free caps restaurants and adds a soft 1,000 monthly-views nudge; Casa unlocks unlimited everything plus the analytics page. Adding a tier is a new folder + one literal.
- **Billing page** combines the current plan card with an invoice ledger filtered by year (`/dashboard/billing`). Plan-switch is a placeholder action — Stripe wires in at the same chokepoint when ready.
- **Casa analytics** at `/dashboard/analytics`: scan-rhythm card with sparkline + 7/30-day bar chart, plus menu / dish / language KPIs derived from the live data.
- **Public menu is cached and tag-invalidated** — `loadRestaurantSnapshot(slug)` wraps `unstable_cache` with a per-slug tag. Every admin mutation calls `revalidateRestaurant(slug)` so the next visitor sees fresh data without polling.
- **View tracking via pixel beacon** at `/api/track/[slug]` — survives any CDN sitting in front of the page; dedupes by `(visitor_cookie, restaurant, hour)`; bot UAs filtered. Powers the dashboard meter and Casa analytics.
- Tenant isolation enforced in the data access layer — every query filters by `restaurantId` after a membership check; storage keys are tenant-prefixed (`r/{restaurantId}/...`) and verified at commit time.
- Templates follow an open/closed registry pattern — adding a new layout is a new folder under `components/menu/templates/<id>/` plus one entry in `registry.ts`.
- End-to-end Playwright suite (~50 specs across 12 modules) covers signup, onboarding, redirects, tenancy, builder CRUD, sample seed, theme + identity editing, QR generation, image uploads, plans, billing, view tracking, and analytics. A fixture fails tests fast on any RSC runtime error or 5xx response.

## Tech stack

- **Next.js 16** (App Router, Turbopack, Cache Components) — `proxy.ts` replaces the old `middleware.ts`.
- **TypeScript** strict, **Tailwind v4**, **shadcn/ui** (Base UI under the hood).
- **Drizzle ORM** with the `postgres-js` driver, **PostgreSQL 18**.
- **Better Auth** with the `organization` plugin.
- **dnd-kit** for drag-and-drop.
- **Bun** as package manager + test runner; **Node** as the production runtime (`next start`).
- **Playwright** for E2E tests.
- Self-hostable: Docker Compose for local services (Postgres, Redis, LocalStack S3).

## Prerequisites

- [Bun](https://bun.sh) ≥ 1.3
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) (or [OrbStack](https://orbstack.dev/)) running locally
- Node.js (used by Playwright; comes with most setups)

## Getting started

```bash
# 1. Install dependencies
bun install

# 2. Bring up Postgres, Redis and LocalStack
docker compose up -d

# 3. Configure environment
cp .env.example .env.local
# generate a real secret and paste it into BETTER_AUTH_SECRET in .env.local
openssl rand -base64 32

# 4. Run migrations
bun run db:migrate

# 5. Start the dev server
bun run dev
```

Open <http://localhost:3000>, sign up, and you'll be taken through onboarding. Your first restaurant gets a default "Main menu" you can fill in immediately.

## Architecture notes

- **Tenant scoping is mandatory.** Every query touching `restaurant`, `menu`, `category`, or `item` filters by `restaurantId` and verifies the caller is a `member` of the parent `organization`. Centralized in `lib/dal.ts`.
- **Schema is the source of truth.** `lib/db/schema.ts` is canonical; migrations are generated, not handwritten.
- **Auth checks live in the data layer, not in layouts.** Next 16 layouts don't re-render on navigation, so layout-only auth checks are unsafe.
- **Drag-and-drop reordering** uses integer `position` columns per parent. On reorder the affected rows are renumbered in a single transaction.
- **Money is integer cents**; currency lives in a separate column.
- **Public-menu cache is per-slug, tag-invalidated.** `lib/menu/cached.ts` wraps `unstable_cache` with `restaurant:${slug}` tags; mutations call the single `revalidateRestaurant(slug)` chokepoint. `unstable_cache` JSON-serializes Dates, so loaders that include timestamps must re-hydrate before returning.
- **View tracking is a pixel beacon.** `/api/track/[slug]` runs outside the cached snapshot, so view counts survive even when the page is served from cache — and would still work behind a CDN.
- **Plans live in a registry.** `lib/plans/` follows the same open/closed pattern as `lib/i18n/` and `components/menu/templates/`. The DB stores raw plan codes; the registry coerces unknown values to the default so a renamed tier never crashes a render.

## Self-hosting (infra)

`infra/` é declarativo, cross-platform, e replicável. **Um único comando provisiona um servidor Ubuntu local idêntico ao de produção.**

```
infra/
  docker/Dockerfile.server    base Ubuntu 24.04 + sshd + utilizador deploy
  tofu/environments/
    local/                    OpenTofu + Docker provider (servidor local)
    prod/                     OpenTofu + Hetzner provider (VPS real)
  ansible/setup.yml           configura Docker, UFW, hardening SSH
                              (mesmo playbook nos dois ambientes)
```

### Pré-requisitos

Comum a todos os SOs: **Docker**, **OpenTofu**, **Ansible**, **make**.

| Plataforma | Notas |
| --- | --- |
| **Linux** | Tudo nativo via package manager (`apt`, `pacman`, …). |
| **macOS** | [OrbStack](https://orbstack.dev/) para Docker (mais leve que Docker Desktop, nativo Apple Silicon). Tofu e Ansible via Homebrew. |
| **Windows** | Docker Desktop + WSL 2 com Ubuntu. **Importante:** activar a WSL Integration para a distro Ubuntu em **Docker Desktop → Settings → Resources → WSL Integration → Ubuntu** (Apply & Restart). Tofu/Ansible/make instalados dentro do WSL. Os comandos `make` correm dentro do WSL. |

### Comandos

```bash
make up        # provisiona servidor local (Tofu + Ansible)
make down      # destrói o servidor local
make recreate  # destrói e recria do zero (~30 segundos)
make ssh       # SSH para o servidor (deploy@localhost:2222)
make help      # lista todos os alvos
```

O servidor local fica acessível em `localhost:2222` como utilizador `deploy`. O mesmo playbook Ansible que corre aqui corre em produção — `infra/tofu/environments/prod/` substitui o container Docker por um VPS Hetzner, com configuração idêntica do servidor.
